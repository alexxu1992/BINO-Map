# BINO-Map
A test for BINO, using ReactNative to create a map related little app.

Here are some steps to run this ReactNative app:

1. Open terminal, install the CRNA globally through npm:
   npm install -g create-react-native-app
   
2. Clone this repo to local:
   git clone <url>
   
3. Entering the local repo in terminal, install all the dependencies:
   npm install
   
4. After finish the installation, start the local server:
   npm start
   (We should see a big QR code appearing inside the terminal)
     
5. Switch to our cell phone, downloading an app called "Expo".

6. Turn on Expo, using the scan feature to scan the QR code on your computer.

7. Connect!

PS: Make sure both the computer and the cell phone are connecting to the same wifi.
